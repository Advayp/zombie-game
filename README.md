## About

This is a game that I am working on that uses the Unity Game Engine.

My focus is **not** on graphics by any means.

The only reason why I am making this game is to learn about the NavMesh system that Unity has.

## Resources to Learn About Unity

[Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/user/Brackeys) is a great resource for learning about the basics of Unity

[Unity](https://unity.com/learn) themselves also have useful resources for learning the basics and some advanced topics in Unity.

[Infallible Code](https://www.youtube.com/user/charlesamat) has tutorials for advanced topics in unity.
